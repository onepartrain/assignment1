# Problem #

The python script `add.py` is supposed to add to numbers together and print out the result, but instead it just prints the numbers next to each other like this:

    $ python add.py 
    First number: 2
    Second number: 2
    22

It should have printed out `4` instead of `22`

# Assignment #

Make `add.py` add work as described above.
